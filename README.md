# Linked-list-in-DSA
A linked list in C++ is a fundamental linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored sequentially. Each node contains a data value and a pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and allow dynamic memory allocation, making them flexible for various applications.
